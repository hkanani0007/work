                <h2>1. Starbucks India</h2>
                Welcome to the wonderful world of coffee sampling at Starbucks! In the cupping room, a dedicated group
                of individuals at our bustling locations in Seattle, Lausanne, and our Farmer Support Centers worldwide
                gather daily to embark on an exciting sensory adventure. Here, they expertly navigate the art of
                sampling coffee, immersing themselves in a delightful journey to uncover the hidden flavors and nuances
                that make our beloved Starbucks brews truly special. So, come along and join us as we dive into this
                captivating exploration, on a quest to discover the perfect cup of coffee!

                <h2> 2.Cupping Rituals:</h2>
                Within these revered cupping rooms, a small group of just 15 individuals possess the expertise to make
                vital determinations regarding the quality and flavor characteristics of our coffee. With a shared
                vocabulary of descriptors and tasting notes, these coffee connoisseurs meticulously calibrate their
                palates. Depending on the season, they may delight in anywhere from 100 to 600 cups of coffee each day,
                accumulating an astounding total of 250,000 cups annually. This extraordinary feat stands as a testament
                to their unwavering dedication and profound passion for their craft.

                <h2> 3.Unveiling the Journey:</h2>
                The journey of coffee sampling is a meticulous process. Green beans are first visually inspected for
                overall quality, then carefully roasted, ground, and infused in boiling water. The tester's olfactory
                senses are tantalized as they breathe in the aromatic brew. After allowing the coffee to settle, the
                tester breaks the crust by gently pushing aside the grounds, inhaling the renewed aroma. And thus, the
                tasting begins.

                    <h2>Starbucks Summer Merchandise</h2>
                    As the warm summer sun beats down, Starbucks releases its latest seasonal merchandise collection
                    that's sure to have coffee and animal lovers roaring with excitement alike The collection is a
                    celebration of the African savannah, one of the many regions that Starbucks sources its coffee from.
                    The theme centers around the happy Giraffe who is joined by a cast of friendly animals, including
                    zebras, and elephants. The playful illustrations depict these creatures enjoying the warm summer
                    breeze, basking in the sunshine, and playfully frolicking among the coffee trees The color palette
                    of the collection is a perfect reflection of summer. Each piece is designed to fit perfectly into
                    your summer beverage routine. They are perfect for a day out in the sun, relaxing with friends or
                    family, or even as a unique and thoughtful gift.
                    <h2>Recycling in Stores</h2>

                    In many of our stores, we recycle at least one type of waste where commercial recycling is available
                    â€“ but it's often happening behind the counter, out of sight to customers. Recycling is dependent on
                    the availability of commercial recycling services where our stores are located. Unfortunately, some
                    local communities that offer comprehensive residential recycling may provide minimal or no
                    commercial recycling. And for stores operating out of leased spaces, it is the landlords who control
                    waste collection and recycling.

                    However, we still have to focus on what we can do and how we can work with others to make recycling
                    easier for us and for our customers.
